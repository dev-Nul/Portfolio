INSTRUCTIONS:

This python module will skim table data off a chosen URL and export it to "skimming.html"
which can be opened in any web browser.*

Although you can find any website on the internet that includes a table and input it into
the script, here are 2 example websites.

1. http://www.geocities.ws/zacharymorritt
2. http://www.sd43.bc.ca/school/charlesbest/Pages/default.aspx

You can search for <div>, <img>, <h1-4>, and <table> tags with this program.

Three guaranteed inputs you can put in to get results are as follows.

1. Datatype: <img>, URL: any url as a result of a google image search.
2. Datatype: <table>, URL: https://www.geocities.ws/zacharymorritt <--------- (MADE BY ME.)
3. Datatype: <p>, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog
