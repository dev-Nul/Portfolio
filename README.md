# Portfolio
For various code-related achievements that I've accomplished to date.

## Python
Python is my first and formost programming language, and subsequently the one I am most familiar with.
Here are several python scripts that I have made.

### 1. Data Skimmer
One of my more ambitious projects to date, siphons data of websites using their respective HTML tags, and the URL, then adds them to a file named skimming.html, based off a subsquent blueprint.html file.

### 2. Cave Crawler
A small RPG game where you can inspect items, the end goal being the escape of the dungeon/cave. Fairly simple but was fun to create.
